# Outline

In this repository you find the code examples discussed in the book.

The notebook `chapter_2_shortest_path.ipynb` provides the code iterations for refactoring the `shortest path` search algorithm discussed in Chapter 2.

The notebook `chapter_3_good_code.ipynb` contains the various examples discussed in the scope of `good` code in the main chapter of the book.

Lastly, the folder `chapter4` contains the test-driven code snippets discussed in the last chapter of the book.

The repository contains a project.toml file of the Python package manager `uv`.
Start the Jupyter Notebook kernel via `uv run python -m notebook` and the environment should come up pre-configured to run the code pieces.
